# World Bank Growth Potential Index

This project is an attempt at real-world data analysis and visualization, built using `pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, and `SciPy`. It uses publicly available World Bank economic data to develop a custom index that ranks countries based on their potential for future economic growth, by projecting economic trends up to 2030.

---

## Features/Points of Focus

- Extracting and cleaning multi-year World Bank economic data from CSV
- Filling missing values using median (grouped by country)
- Manual slope calculation using `np.polyfit()` to project long-term economic trends
- Applying min-max normalization
- Getting rid of some outliers after normalizing data
- Assigning weights according to a custom metric explained below to selected eceonomic indicators in order to compute a raw GPI score
- Project trends in economic indicators upto the year 2030 using slopes of economic indicators generated by linear regression
- Creating a ranked Growth Potential Index scaled to 0–100
- Visualizing results with matplotlib and seaborn using:
  - Boxplots (raw and weighted indicator distributions) 
  - Bar chart (top 10 countries by growth potential)
  - Heatmap (indicator correlations)
  - Line graph (global economic indicator trends with forecast region shaded)
- Saving important dataframes to CSV
- Saving a summary summary statistics of predictions to `summary_stats.csv`

## Indicators and Weights Used

| Indicator                          | Weight | Description                             |
|-----------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
| GDP Growth (% Annual)             | +0.15  | Measures actual growth rate              |
| GDP per Capita (Current USD)      | +0.25  | Reflects wealth (USD-based, not relative)|
| Unemployment Rate (%)             | -0.25  | Penalized (lower is better)              |
| Inflation (CPI %)                 | -0.20  | Penalized (lower is better)              |
| Current Account Balance (% GDP)   | +0.15  | Reflects ability to spend on development |
